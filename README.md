This is a landing page to try to get Beans (my dog) a job!

I have more confidence after going through the new Flexbox tutorial and I think the final result looks pretty good. Could always add more functionality features or a little more design touches but this gets the point across.

Picture 3 being bigger than the others bothers me. I didn't use another picture and didn't want to spent too much time at the moment getting it cropped to fit the same size as the other pics.
